                    <p>We all know the feeling when you see the 'SOLD OUT' screen on your laptop or phone. You tried to buy a ticket with several computers and still didn't make it. We made an application that will give you a second chance.
                    On this site you can find tickets from people who can't make the event. You can make an account and try to buy their ticket so you can still make the event.
                        Are you the person who can't make the event? We got you! Make an account and fill the form in. Then your ticket(s) will be available for sale. We give you a chance to get your money back, because we know how expensive some events can be!</p>
